This website is an  website with a focus on showcasing meal prep and pre-preped services
There are 2 highlighted features that I would like to highlight about this page
Number 1, it has an order function
For example, you can click on the order function, and the couple food otpions that you click on can be saved
Number 2, it has a review page
This is an interactive review page, that is updated whenever you publish a review
It is saved in a local dom storage so it isnt removed upon a refresh

The other features include a service page with its subsections, a contact-us section(with a google map embedded into it), and a interactive page for an about us, with the images clickable to enlarge it below

It is also mobile responsive, with its headers rearranging to a vertical arrangement to better fit the style arrangement
